DATA MINING ALGORITHM implementations using 3 reasearch papers.

The project does the ML analysis on the data procured from the IMDb database using all of the above-mentioned algorithms. These algorithms (Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree and Support Vector Machines) work best on different datasets but to bring them to a fairground, a fresh IMDb database has been used. Firstly, the data is cleaned, pre-processed, pruned and then integrated in order to provide the classifiers the best meaningful data possible. The classifiers are scripted in the Python language  from  scratch  considering  for  the  analysis.  Finally,  the  analysis  is  carried  out  in  the developed classifiers and a comparison study is formulated.
