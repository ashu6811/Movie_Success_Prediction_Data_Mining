## Group 17

## Group members
- Gursimran Singh (40080981)
- Ufuoma Ubor (40072909)
- Darshan Dhananjay (40079241)
- Ashmeet Singh (40070369)

## Title of project 
- Hit or Flop: Box office Prediction Using Data Mining Techniques

## Dataset file ( Source: IMDB https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset )
- tmdb_5000_movies.csv

## Steps to run code
1. Place all the code and the dataset in the same folder.
2. Open the terminal/ command prompt.
3. Execute the python code by providing the python execute command
    -> py knn_movie_success_prediction.py / knn_movie_success_prediction.py for kNN algorithm to execute 
    -> py naivebayes_movie_success_prediction.py / naivebayes_movie_success_prediction.py for Naive Bayes algorithm
    -> py svm_movie_success_prediction.py / svm_movie_success_prediction for svm algorithms to execute

In each one you will see the confusion matrix and the classification report providing precision, recall, accuracy for each of the class
and the average accuracy and weight accracy 


## Contributions
Name	Tasks Performed
Gursimran Singh 	
1. Researching about the dataset which relates to the research papers that we selected and then selected the dataset.

2. The code implementation of Naïve Bayes with Ashmeet from scratch which takes input data, cleans it, partitions it and apply the Naïve Bayes algorithm.
3. Writing the report, specifically the Related Studies, Experiments, Results and References. Also created the project presentation (Research Papers Used and Comparison)

Ufuoma Ubor	
1. Implementation of SVM algorithm from scratch with Darshan Dhananjay.
2. Worked on project report (Algorithm results, Data Preprocessing)
3. Project Presentation(Future Work)

Darshan Dhananjay	
1. Researching on the feature extraction and correlation techniques between the features and the resulting values using seaborn’s Heatmap.
2. Discussing and Implementing the SVM algorithm with Ufuoma , Data Cleaning techniques such as removing the null values, empty values also manual labeling of the data.
3. Contributed in the reports by writing the understanding of the research papers techniques and algorithms and handled dataset processing techniques in presentation.

Ashmeet Singh	
1. Implemented Naïve Bayes Algorithm from scratch with Gursimran in python, data cleaning and cross validation.
2. Worked on project Presentation (Introduction, Future Work)
3. Worked on project report (Naïve Bayes experiment and results).
